1. Create a class SET. Create member functions to perform the following SET operations:

1) is member: check whether an element belongs to the set or not and return value as true/false.

2) powerset: list all the elements of the power set of a set.

3) subset: Check whether one set is a subset of the other or not.

4) union and Intersection of two Sets.

5) complement: Assume Universal Set as per the input elements from the user.

6) set Difference and Symmetric Difference between two sets.

7) cartesian Product of Sets.

Write a menu driven program to perform the above functions on an instance of the

SET class.
